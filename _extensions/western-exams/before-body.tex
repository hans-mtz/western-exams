    \begin{itemize}
        \item You will have 2 hours to complete the exam.
        \item Make sure to check that your scantron version matches your exam version.
        \item Make sure to write your name and student number on the exam and to fill in your student number in the scantron.
        \item You may have pencils, erasers, your student card, and a non-graphing non-programmable calculator out of its case on your desk. All other items including watches, and cell-phones must be left in your bag at the front of the examination room.
        \item Please make sure all electronic devices (cell phones, laptops, etc.) are turned off before storing them at the front of the examination room.
        \item When you have finished, please hand in your exam, scrap paper, and scantron. Failure to do so will result in a mark of zero for the exam.
        \item Please make sure that you clearly label all graphs and drawings to get the full marks.
        \item Good luck!
